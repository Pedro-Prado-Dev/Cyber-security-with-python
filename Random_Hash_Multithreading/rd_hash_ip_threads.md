# Information Security Projects with Python

This repository contains four simple projects focused on information security using Python. Each project addresses a specific concept, such as hash comparison, IP manipulation, password generation, and threading.

## Projects

### Hash Compare

The `hash_compare` project compares file hashes to verify if they are identical, useful for validating file integrity.

- **hash_compare.py**: Script to compare hashes of two files.

### IPS

The `ips` project manipulates IP addresses, checking their validity and performing other related operations.

- **ips.py**: Script for IP manipulation and validation.

### Password Generator

The `password_generator` project generates secure passwords randomly based on user-defined criteria such as length and complexity.

- **password_generator.py**: Script to generate secure passwords.

### Threads

The `threads` project demonstrates the use of threads in Python to perform simultaneous tasks, improving the efficiency of programs that execute multiple independent operations.

- **threads.py**: Script demonstrating the use of threads.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional libraries (specified in each project, if needed)

## File Structure

- `Random_Hash_Multithreading/hash_compare.py`: Script for hash comparison.
- `Random_Hash_Multithreading/ips.py`: Script for IP manipulation.
- `Random_Hash_Multithreading/password_generator.py`: Script for password generation.
- `Random_Hash_Multithreading/threads.py`: Script for threading demonstration.

## How to Use

### Hash Compare (`Random_Hash_Multithreading/hash_compare.py`)

The `hash_compare.py` script compares the hashes of two files.

1. Navigate to the `hash_compare` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Random_Hash_Multithreading
    ```

2. Run the script with the files to be compared:
    ```bash
    python hash_compare.py
    ```

### IPS (`Random_Hash_Multithreading/ips.py`)

The `ips.py` script manipulates IP addresses, checking their validity and performing other operations.

1. Navigate to the `ips` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Random_Hash_Multithreading
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python ips.py
    ```

### Password Generator (`password_generator/password_generator.py`)

The `password_generator.py` script generates secure passwords.

1. Navigate to the `password_generator` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Random_Hash_Multithreading
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

3. Example with optional parameters:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py --size 12
    ```

### Threads (`Random_Hash_Multithreading/threads.py`)

The `threads.py` script demonstrates the use of threads to perform simultaneous tasks.

1. Navigate to the `threads` folder:
    ```bash
    cd Random_Hash_Multithreading
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python threads.py
    ```

## Examples:

- [hash_compare](hash_compare.py)
- [ips](ips.py)
- [password_generator](password_generator.py)
- [threads](threads.py)
